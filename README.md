# Project 2 : Bellabeat-Wellness-Analysis

### Project is done with Python

This case study is the capstone project of Google Data Analytics Professional Certification.In this case study I am working as the a junior data analyst on the marketing analyst team at Bellabeat.

Bellabeat is a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women. Founded in 2013 by artist Urška Sršen and mathematician Sando Mur, the company has many products carefully designed to monitor activity, stress, sleep, and reproductive data to help women better understand how their bodies work and make healthier choices. While Bellabeat is a successful small company, but they have the potential to become a larger player in the global smart device market.

Urška Sršen, cofounder and Chief Creative Officer of Bellabeat, believes that analyzing smart device fitness data could help unlock new growth opportunities for the company.

The dataset I used from [fitbit_fitness_tracker](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit).The 18 CSV files contains personal fitness tracker from thirty fitbit users. Thirty eligible Fitbit users consented to the submission of personal tracker data, including minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. It includes information about daily activity, steps, and heart rate that can be used to explore users’ habits.
